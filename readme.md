# Everlearning kali
This is a glorified init script to customize the latest KALI vm images from offsec.
I used this script and keep it up to date in order to create my attacking machines with my customizations in a matter of minutes.

I personally use vmware for this, but this could be used on an actual kali laptop or something of the likes.
